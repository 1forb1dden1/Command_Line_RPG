# TurnBasedFIghtingSimulator
The player takes turns with the monster that the user chooses to fight. At this time, the only inputs that the user can make during the interaction are to (1) Attack (2) Run. There is no exp system so the player cannot level up. This program will be left alone and never touched as I've programmed it very sloppily and the code has become very disorganized. I will probably come back to a project like this again in the future when I have a better understanding of how to separate my files and OOP.
